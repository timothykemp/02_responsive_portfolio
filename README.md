# 02_Responsive_Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio website was my second homework assignment in the KU Coding Bootcamp. The content is real, and that is actually a picture of me! The main purpose of this project was to experience what it is like to develop responsive websites using a combination of HTML and CSS, specifically with the power of Bootstrap.

## Deployed Version

<https://timothykemp.dev/02_responsive_portfolio>

## Important Notes

1. This project has been deployed; however, the current Contact Form does not work yet, as the code required for that functionality has not been covered in class.

1. The portfolio page contains placeholder images for now, but they will be replaced as I develop more projects.
